- **Cancer Type:** Skin Cutaneous Melanoma
- **Objective:** Evaluated transcriptomic and immune profiling in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4.
- **Summary of Dataset:** Analyzed transcriptomic and immune profiling in 158 tumor biopsies from melanoma patients treated with either anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. The study identified activated T cell signatures and T cell populations in responders to both treatments. The gene expression profile of this population was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with a single agent and greater tumor shrinkage in both treatments.
