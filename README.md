- **Cancer Type:** Skin Cutaneous Melanoma
- **Objective:** Evaluated transcriptomic and immune profiling in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4.
- **Summary of Dataset:** 
  - Analysis focused on identifying T cell signatures and populations associated with treatment response. Results linked activated T cell signatures to
     longer progression-free survival (PFS) and greater tumor shrinkage in responders.
